    <h3>Gustaf Enebog Braided flask 2021 Pencil on paper 30x22 cm</h3>
    <p>This original work is a very fine and detailed still life. It portrays a cord wrapped bottle (done in yesteryears to protect frail glass) bought at a handicraft shop at the Waxholm in the Stockholm archipelago. I was fascinated by the twists and turns of the cord, and it made for a wonderful and intense still life</p>
